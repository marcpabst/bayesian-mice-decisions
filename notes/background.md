# Mathematical Methods

The purpose of this note is to establish the theoretical basis for extending the work by Ashwood et al. I will first highlight the mathematical model of the hidden Markov model (HMM) used and then briefly cover the reasoning behind using (approximate) leave-one-out cross-validation to obtain the pointwise predictive probability to compare different models as opposed to normalized likelihoods in the case of Ashwood et al.

## The Model



### Observation Model

We assume that observations are generated from a $Bernoulli(p)$ distribution with the probability $p$ given by

$$p = \operatorname{Pr}\left(y_{t}=1 \mid z_{t}=k, u_{t}, \gamma_{k}\right)=\frac{1}{1+\exp \left( u_{t} \gamma_{k}^\top\right)}$$

Here, $y=1$ indicates a rightward decision and $y=0$ indicates a leftward decision, $z_t$ is the hidden state at time $t$, $u_t$ represents the vector of predictors at time $t$ and $\gamma_{k}$ is the vector of coefficients for state $k$.

Thus, $p$ is given by a sigmoid function and can be viewed as a logistic regression. The time-varying emission vector $\mathbf{\vec b}(t)$ reflecting the probability of observing $y_t$ in state $j$ is given by

$$b_j(t) = \operatorname{Pr}\left(y_t \mid z_t=j\right)$$

Using the probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution, we can write the observation model as

$$ 
b_j(t) =
\begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{1+\exp \left( u_{t} \gamma_{j}^\top\right)} & \text{if } y_t =1, \\
   1-\frac{1}{1+\exp \left( u_{t} \gamma_{j}^\top\right)} & \text {if } y_t = 0.
 \end{cases}
$$

### Transition Model
The time-varying transition matrix $\mathbf{A}(t)\in \mathbb{R}_+^{K\times K}$ is given by

$$ a_{i,j}(t) = \operatorname{Pr}(z_t = j |z_{t-1} = i, \vec{u}_t) = \operatorname{softmax}\left(d_{i,j} + u_t \beta_i^\top  \right) = \frac{\exp\left(d_{i,j} + u_t \beta_i^\top  \right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{i} \exp \left(d_{i,j} + u_t \beta_i^\top \right)}$$

In other words, for each of the $K$ states, a multinomial logistic regression is used to predict the probability of the next possible $K$ states. Importantly, while we allow the intercept to vary between states, the coefficients are fixed and only depend on the previous state ($z_{t-1} = i$).

## Fitting the Model
### The Forward Algorithm

The forward algorithm is used to iteratively compute the probability of an observation sequence given the initial state probabilities $\pi$, the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}(t)$ and the emission vector $\mathbf{\vec b}(t)$. By integrating (marginalizing) over all possible state sequences, we obtain the probability of the observation sequence up to time $t$, **only** conditional on the hidden state at time $t$ (in theory, one could just na√Øvely sum over the probabilities under all possible state sequences, but this is intractable due to combinational explosion).

$$\alpha_{\mathrm{t}}(i) =\operatorname{Pr}\left(y_1 \ldots y_t, z_t=i\right)$$
$$\alpha_{t+1}(j)=\sum_{i=1}^{K} \alpha_{t}(i) a_{ij} b_{j}(t+1)$$
The initial value $\alpha_1(i)$ is calculated using $\pi_i$.
$$\alpha_{t=1}(i) = \pi_i \cdot b_{i}(1)$$

The sum over all possible end states at $t$ is sufficient to compute the likelihood of the observation sequence $y_1, \ldots, y_t$.

$$\mathrm{L}(y_1, \ldots, y_t) = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \alpha_{t}(i)$$


### Point Estimates
The forward algoritm can be combined with the so-called backward algorithm to compute the probability of a particular latent state at time $t$ (the process is then fittingly termed forward-backward-algorithm). This information can then be used in an interative procedure known as expectation maximization (EM) to find the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the observation sequence. EM works by repeatedly finding the most likely state sequence (E-step) and subsequently maximizing the likelihood by adjusting the other parameters (M-step). 

Other options include direct Maximal Likelihood estimation a Variational Bayes estimations.

### Full Baysian Inference
#### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures such as Gibb's sampling or Hamitonian Monte Carlo (HMC) can be used to sample from the posterior distributions. 



- $K$: Number of different states
- $P$: Number of predictors for transitions model.
- $M$: Number of predictors for observation model.
